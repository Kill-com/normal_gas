The program plots using the Clapeyron Mendeleev equation, where the weight is constant
  m = const;
  PV = T

To builds program requests intermediate changes between states. 
As well as all the equalities that are contained in the graph.

The output will be a coordinate system in 3 different projections.

1: y=P;  x=T
2: y=V;  x=T
3: y=P;  x=V
